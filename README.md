# Summary-Dashboard

This project is a **full-stack interactive summary dashboard** that visualizes **Bookings, Billings, and Backlogs** across multiple business dimensions such as **Region, Product, and Customer**.

The dashboard helps stakeholders:

* Monitor monthly trends
* Analyze book-to-bill ratios
* Understand backlog distribution
* Drill down into detailed summaries

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Excel (.xlsx)
   ↓
Node.js (Express API)
   ↓
React + MUI + Recharts Dashboard
```

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fullstack-summary-dashboard
```

---

### 2️⃣ Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Place the Excel file at:

```
backend/data/FullStack_Summary_Dashboard_Data.xlsx
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
node server.js
```

Backend will run on:

```
http://localhost:4000
```

---

### 3️⃣ Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Frontend will run on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. Backend parses Excel sheets and applies **date filtering**
2. REST API exposes aggregated and raw data
3. Frontend applies **Region / Product / Customer filters**
4. Summary cards, charts, and table update in real time

---

## 🧠 Design Decisions

* Date filtering handled in backend to reduce payload size
* Business filters handled in frontend for fast interactivity
* Summary calculations derived from filtered data to ensure accuracy
* Clear separation of concerns between backend and frontend

---

## 🧪 Validation

* Metrics validated against Excel source data
* Book-to-Bill ratios calculated accurately
* Charts and summary remain synchronized under all filters

---

## 📤 Export

* Export filtered drill-down table as **CSV**

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Year-to-Date (YTD) toggle
* Backlog forecasting using expected shipping dates
* Authentication and role-based access
* Database integration (PostgreSQL / MongoDB)
